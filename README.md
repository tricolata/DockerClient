# DockerClient App
This java application is a Command Line client for interacting with a docker server and display info to console.

## Installation Guide
There is not a way to install it yet

## Usage
Coming Soon

## RoadMap:
There are the things I want to accomplish
* Create a docker client that displays docker images & containers
* add, update or delete images
* start, stop or show status of containers
* remove containers
* display dockerfile content
* display resource usage of each or all running containers
* display storage info of images
